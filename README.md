# Streamr Native SDK

This is the ongoing development repository for the Streamr Native SDK, a native counterpart of the [streamr-dev/network](https://github.com/your-github-username/streamr-dev/network).

## Clone the repository

**Note:** When cloning the repository, it is crucial to use the `--recursive` flag. This flag is necessary for initializing and updating the submodules that are part of this repository. Without it, the submodules will not be downloaded, leading to missing dependencies and build failures.

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:streamr-dev/native-sdk.git
```
